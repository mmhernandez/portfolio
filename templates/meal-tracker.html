					<h5>This app was created for a family member who began a diet plan with a local weight loss company. Unfortunately, the company did not offer any means for electronic meal tracking and only provided customers with lined paper to document their progress. Voil√† - a perfect project opportunity was born!</h5>

						When looking at a daily log page, a summary displays at the top for a quick view of the user's daily macros. Dynamic Add/Update buttons display based on previously entered user data for that date and section.
					</p>

					<h5>Project Details</h5>
					<p>
						<span class="image left">
							<span class="icon solid style1 major fa-list-check"></span>
						</span>
						Users open the calendar from the dashboard or navbar to select the day where they want to log information. The calendar always encircles the current day, and any dates highlighted indicate the user has made a daily log on that date. Users also have access to their account, to add/update information. <br><br>
						Did I mention the dashboard also includes snapshots of the users weight loss, inches lost, and exercise consistency percent? Weight loss and inches lost are based on the last time the user updated a daily log with each piece of information.
					</p>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-50">
							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/meal_tracker_dashboard_calendar.png" alt="Meal Tracker Dashboard Calendar"/></span></div>
							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/meal_tracker_account.png" alt="Meal Tracker Account Page" /></span></div>
						</div>

						</span>
						This app was built to support users on their weight loss journey, which means meal tracking as well as exercise tracking and assistance. An excercise API was used to provide 10 random exercises based on user-selected muscle groups to inspire and motivate! <br><br>
						It's also important to be able to view daily activity at a glance. Two reports are available to users, a <span class="fw-bold">Detailed Weekly Report</span> and a <span class="fw-bold">Condensed Monthly Report</span>, accessible from the dashboard.
					</p>

					<h5>Application Deployment</h5>
					<p>
						<span class="image left">
							<span class="icon brands style1 major2 fa-aws"></span>
						</span>
						This project was deployed to AWS in an Amazon EC2 instance. A domain was purchased from Amazon and connected to the EC2 instance using the Amazon Route53 service. An SSL certificate was also purchased; using the Load Balancer tool, traffic is routed to HTTPS and references the cert for a secure site experience for users.
